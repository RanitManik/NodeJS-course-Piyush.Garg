## Express Middleware

### Introduction

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, known for its simplicity and flexibility. One of the key
features that make Express powerful is middleware. Middleware functions are the building blocks of Express applications,
enabling developers to add custom functionality to the request-response cycle. This document aims to provide a
comprehensive overview of Express middleware, its purpose, implementation, and best practices.

### What is Middleware?

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next
middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions can perform tasks such as:

1. Executing any code.
2. Modifying request and response objects.
3. Ending the request-response cycle.
4. Calling the next middleware function in the stack.

### Types of Middleware

Express middleware can be categorized into the following types:

1. Application-level Middleware: These middleware functions are bound to the Express application and are executed for
   every incoming request. They are ideal for tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.

2. Router-level Middleware: Router-level middleware works similar to application-level middleware but is bound to
   specific routes or route parameters. They are useful for modularizing route-specific functionality.

3. Error Handling Middleware: Error handling middleware functions are specifically designed to handle errors that occur
   during the execution of previous middleware functions or route handlers. They are defined with four parameters (err,
   req, res, next) and are typically placed at the end of the middleware stack.

4. Built-in Middleware: Express provides several built-in middleware functions to handle common tasks such as serving
   static files, parsing request bodies, and managing sessions.

### Writing Middleware
Writing custom middleware in Express is straightforward. Middleware functions are simply JavaScript functions with
access to the request, response, and next parameters. Here’s an example of a simple middleware function that logs the
request URL:

```javascript
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Request URL: ${req.url}`);
    next();
};
```

### Using Middleware

Middleware functions are added to the Express application or router using the `app.use()` or `router.use()` method.
Here’s an example of how to use middleware in an Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Application-level middleware
app.use(logRequest);

// Router-level middleware
const router = express.Router();
router.use(authenticateUser);

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});
```

### Conclusion

Express middleware is a powerful feature that enables developers to enhance the functionality of their applications. By
understanding the different types of middleware and how to write and use them effectively, developers can create robust
and scalable Express applications. Whether it’s logging requests, authenticating users, or handling errors, middleware
plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of Express applications.
